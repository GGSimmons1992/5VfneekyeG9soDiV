# Potential Talents
## Background
This project uses spaCy to rank and sort candidates based on how thier job title is similar to the hiring manager's search query. rankPotentials.py asks the user to enter a query and how many top candidates they want to see on the screen. It will then proceed to ask the user if they want to star a particular visible candidate, and it will re-calculate based off of the starred candidate.

## data
data is not pushed due to gitignore. Raw data from Apziva is in Raw folder. Final refinements will be saved in the results folder

## src/rankPotentials
Running rankPotentials.py in src will inquire inputs from the user for a query, how many candidates desired to be seen on the screen, and if they want to star a particular top to refine the search. Final refinements will be saved in the results folder
